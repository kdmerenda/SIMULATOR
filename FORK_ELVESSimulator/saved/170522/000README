THis has the files for a simulated event with peak current 150000, which seems to be to high for the amplitude, even with atmo on. THis is located for Run5254 Evt6336, Eye1, Tel3 comparaison. There is a problem with traces still too sharp wrt one another... there should be less of an amplitude change between rows.  attempt at comparaison needed.

Also this was for Auger3D_5kmSource_FINE_1000m_1000pt_500ns_SIBC_0.5c_MTLE_1.5e05

note that attempts with Ic = 100000 are too dim to be seen on the detector with atm. Need to simualte smthg halfway. Also diff between 0,5 vs 0m7c needs to be checed. 



FYI on XML for sim:

  <NumberOfDiaphragmEntryPoints> 1 </NumberOfDiaphragmEntryPoints>

  <!-- Number of simulation entries to skip when creating photons. 1 is minimum, or else for loop wont increment-->
    <PhotonDiscretization> 1 </PhotonDiscretization>

  <!-- 0 means inactive, uses all entries. Or put a number to loop through X first tree entries in tree with ELVESTreeName -->
    <NumberOfTreeEntries> 000000 </NumberOfTreeEntries>

  <!-- Frame Selection of 0 means no constraint on which 100 us frame is selected. Also, amount of loops in module sequence is not important. THough, if wanting to select a\
   frame, make sure loop is set to 1 in module sequence. eg: 2, this will select the frame from 100-200 us... aka the secont event in a run with number loop (in module sequen\
   ce) greater than 2.  -->
     <FrameSelection> 0 </FrameSelection>

  <!-- do's and don't do's-->
    <!-- output the traces using graphical cuts for row 10 and column10... this is a way to precheck before raytracing-->
      <PreCheck> 0 </PreCheck>
        <!-- the geometric correction is applied to all entries by calculating how far way that grid cell is from the detector. Mirror_radius^2/(4*distance^2)-->
