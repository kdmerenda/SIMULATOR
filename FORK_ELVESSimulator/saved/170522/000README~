THis has the files for a simulated event with peak current 150000, which seems to be to high for the amplitude, even with atmo on. THis is located for Run5254 Evt6336, Eye1, Tel3 comparaison. There is a problem with traces still too sharp wrt one another... there should be less of an amplitude change between rows.
